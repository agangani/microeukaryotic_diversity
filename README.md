# microeukaryotic_diversity
The ecological impacts of microeukaryotes in marine systems is well documented and understood. However, the microeukaryotic communities that are endogenous to freshwater systems are significantly understudied with respect to their marine counterparts. It is known that microeukaryotes play key roles in nutrient cycling, bioremediation, and higher eukaryotic nutrition. Gaining a better understanding of these organisms through analyses of species richness and diversity will allow researchers to begin to more accurately characterize specific roles in ecological processes. One common method for beginning such ecological studies is analysis of 18S rRNA data. Therefore, our project aims to build a pipeline that will automate the execution of the amplicon sequence data analysis tool mothur (Kozich et al. 2013).
